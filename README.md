# PasswordlessLogin-Authentication

Passwordless authentication is a security method that allows users to access their accounts or systems without using traditional passwords. Instead of relying on a secret combination of characters, passwordless authentication uses alternative methods to verify a user's identity. These methods can include:

Biometrics, One-Time Code, Hardware Tokens etc..
In his case we are using a One-Time Code

Passwordless authentication is important for several reasons:

1. Enhanced Security: Traditional passwords can be easily stolen or guessed, making accounts vulnerable to unauthorized access. Passwordless methods, especially biometrics and hardware tokens, offer stronger security because they are unique to each user.

2. Reduced Risk of Password-related Issues: Passwords can be forgotten, shared, or reused across multiple accounts, which can lead to security breaches. Passwordless methods eliminate these issues.

3. Improved User Experience: Passwordless authentication is often more convenient for users because it eliminates the need to remember and manage complex passwords. This can result in faster and smoother access to accounts and systems.

4. Resistance to Phishing Attacks: Passwordless methods are less susceptible to phishing attacks because even if a user is tricked into providing their username, an attacker won't have the necessary biometric data, hardware token, or one-time code to gain access.

5. Compliance with Regulations: Some data protection regulations, such as GDPR, encourage or require organizations to implement strong authentication methods. Passwordless authentication can help organizations meet these requirements.

In summary, passwordless authentication is a more secure and user-friendly way to confirm a user's identity, reducing the risks associated with traditional passwords and improving overall security.
